  abstract = {Methods for deep-penetration radiation transport remain important for radiation shielding, nonproliferation, nuclear threat reduction, and medical applications. As these applications become more ubiquitous, the need for accurate and reliable transport methods appropriate for these systems persists. For such systems, hybrid methods often obtain reliable answers in the shortest time by leveraging the speed and uniform uncertainty distribution of a deterministic solution to bias Monte Carlo transport and reduce the variance in the solution. This work reviews the state of the art among such hybrid methods. First, we summarize variance reduction (VR) for Monte Carlo radiation transport and existing efforts to automate these techniques. Relations among VR, importance, and the adjoint solution of the neutron transport equation are then discussed. Based on this exposition, the work transitions from theory to a critical review of existing VR implementations in modern nuclear engineering software. At present, the Consistent Adjoint-Driven Importance Sampling (CADIS) and Forward-Weighted Consistent Adjoint-Driven Importance Sampling (FW-CADIS) hybrid methods are the gold standard by which to reduce the variance in problems that have deeply penetrating radiation. The CADIS and FW-CADIS methods use an adjoint scalar flux to generate VR parameters for Monte Carlo radiation transport. Additionally, efforts to incorporate angular information into VR methods for Monte Carlo are summarized. Finally, we assess various implementations of these methods and the degree to which they improve VR for their target applications.}

  abstract = {Although the Monte Carlo method is considered to be the most accurate method available for solving radiation transport problems, its applicability is limited by its computational expense. Thus, biasing techniques, which require intuition, guesswork, and iterations involving manual adjustments, are employed to make reactor shielding calculations feasible. To overcome this difficulty, we have developed a method for using the SN adjoint function for automated variance reduction of Monte Carlo calculations through source biasing and consistent transport biasing with the weight window technique. We describe the implementation of this method into the standard production Monte Carlo code MCNP and its application to a realistic calculation, namely, the reactor cavity dosimetry calculation. The computational effectiveness of the method, as demonstrated through the increase in calculational efficiency, is demonstrated and quantified. Important issues associated with this method and its efficient use are addressed and analyzed. Additional benefits in terms of the reduction in time and effort required of the user are difficult to quantify but are possibly as important as the computational efficiency. In general, the automated variance reduction method presented is capable of increases in computational performance on the order of thousands, while at the same time significantly reducing the current requirements for user experience, time, and effort. Therefore, this method can substantially increase the applicability and reliability of Monte Carlo for large, real-world shielding applications.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a hybrid (Monte Carlo/deterministic) method for increasing the efficiency of Monte Carlo calculations of distributions, such as flux or dose rate distributions (e.g., mesh tallies), as well as responses at multiple localized detectors and spectra. This method, referred to as Forward-Weighted CADIS (FW-CADIS), is an extension of the Consistent Adjoint Driven Importance Sampling (CADIS) method, which has been used for more than a decade to very effectively improve the efficiency of Monte Carlo calculations of localized quantities (e.g., flux, dose, or reaction rate at a specific location). The basis of this method is the development of an importance function that represents the importance of particles to the objective of uniform Monte Carlo particle density in the desired tally regions. Implementation of this method utilizes the results from a forward deterministic calculation to develop a forward-weighted source for a deterministic adjoint calculation. The resulting adjoint function is then used to generate consistent space-and energy-dependent source biasing parameters and weight windows that are used in a forward Monte Carlo calculation to obtain more uniform statistical uncertainties in the desired tally regions. The FW-CADIS method has been implemented and demonstrated within the MAVRIC (Monaco with Automated Variance Reduction using Importance Calculations) sequence of SCALE and the ADVANTG (Automated Deterministic Variance Reduction Generator)/MCNP framework. Application of the method to representative real-world problems, including calculation of dose rate and energy-dependent flux throughout the problem space, dose rates in specific areas, and energy spectra at multiple detectors, is presented and discussed. Results of the FW-CADIS method and other recently developed global variance-reduction approaches are also compared, and the FW-CADIS method outperformed the other methods in all cases considered.},
